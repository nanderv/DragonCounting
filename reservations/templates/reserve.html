    Due to government regulations, we have to work with reservations. Outside opening hours, the reservations are handled
    'ad-hoc', which means that the opener 'reserves' a spot for you.<br/>
    During opening hours we work with reservations. You have to reserve if you're planning to visit for a 'customer-task', not
    if you are a committee-member that wants to work on things.</br />

    In the afternoon, {{ available_afternoon }} places are taken.<br/>
    In the evening, {{ available_evening }} places are taken.<br/>
    The total capacity of the room is {{ maximum }}.<br/>
